### ðŸ§  Answer:

To troubleshoot network connectivity issues on a Linux server, I would:

1. **Check network interface and IP address:**
   ```bash
   ip a
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   ifconfig
   ```
   Ensure the interface is up and has a valid IP.

2. **Ping the external service or IP:**
   ```bash
   ping <external-service-domain-or-ip>
   ```
   Confirm if itâ€™s reachable.

3. **Check DNS resolution:**
   ```bash
   nslookup <external-service-domain>
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   dig <external-service-domain>
   ```
   Make sure DNS is resolving correctly.

4. **Check routing table:**
   ```bash
   ip route
   ```
   Confirm the default gateway is set properly.

5. **Check firewall settings:**
   ```bash
   sudo iptables -L -v
   ```
   or if using `firewalld`:
   ```bash
   sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
   ```
   Ensure outbound traffic isnâ€™t blocked.

6. **Test connection with `curl` or `telnet`:**
   ```bash
   curl -v https://<external-service-domain>
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   telnet <external-service-ip> <port>
   ```

7. **Check proxy settings if applicable:**
   ```bash
   echo $HTTP_PROXY
   echo $HTTPS_PROXY
   ```
   Make sure proxy isnâ€™t blocking access.

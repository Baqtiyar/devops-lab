### ðŸ§  Answer:

To troubleshoot a slow Linux server, I would follow these steps:

1. **Check system resource usage:**
   - CPU and memory usage:
     ```bash
     top
     ```
     or
     ```bash
     htop
     ```
   - Look for processes consuming high CPU or memory.

2. **Check disk space:**
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```
   Ensure no partitions are full.

3. **Check disk I/O:**
   ```bash
   iostat -x 1 3
   ```
   (If `iostat` isnâ€™t installed, use `sudo apt install sysstat`)

4. **Check running processes:**
   ```bash
   ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -10
   ```
   Identify top CPU-consuming processes.

5. **Check system logs:**
   ```bash
   tail -n 50 /var/log/syslog
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   journalctl -xe
   ```
   Look for errors or warnings.

6. **Check for network issues:**
   ```bash
   netstat -tulnp
   ```
   Or use `ss` command.

7. **Check for zombie or stuck processes:**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep Z
   ```

### ðŸ§  Answer:

To troubleshoot a cron job that isnâ€™t executing as expected, I would follow these steps:

1. **Check the current cron jobs for the user:**
   ```bash
   crontab -l
   ```
   This confirms whether the job is correctly scheduled.

2. **Check the cron schedule syntax:**
   - Ensure the job is written in proper format.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     0 2 * * * /home/ubuntu/scripts/data_etl.sh >> /var/log/data_etl.log 2>&1
     ```

3. **Check if the script is executable:**
   ```bash
   ls -l /home/ubuntu/scripts/data_etl.sh
   chmod +x /home/ubuntu/scrip

# What is Docker?

**Docker** is a platform that allows you to **create**, **build**, **manage**, **ship**, **deploy**, and **run** applications using containerization.

## Key Actions Docker Enables:

- **Create**: Write code and define how the application should behave using a `Dockerfile`.
- **Build**: Use `docker build` to create a Docker image from your code and configuration.
- **Manage**: Organize and handle containers, images, volumes, and networks using Docker CLI or Docker Compose.
- **Ship**: Push Docker images to a registry (like Docker Hub or Amazon ECR) to distribute them.
- **Deploy**: Launch containers from Docker images in any environmentâ€”local, cloud, or Kubernetes cluster.
- **Run**: Start the application in a lightweight, isolated container environment.

> Docker ensures that applications run **consistently** across different systems by packaging everything into containers.

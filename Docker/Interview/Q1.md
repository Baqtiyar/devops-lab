## Docker Container Crashes After Start

### üìå Question:
You are working on a microservices project. A developer raises an issue saying their Docker container crashes shortly after starting. You are asked to debug the issue. How would you approach this problem using Linux and Docker commands?

### üß† Answer:

To troubleshoot the container crash, I would follow these steps:

1. **Check if the container is exiting:**
   ```bash
   docker ps -a
   ```
   This shows running and exited containers, confirming whether the container stopped immediately.

2. **View container logs:**
   ```bash
   docker logs <container_id>
   ```
   This helps identify error messages from the application inside the container.

3. **Inspect the container‚Äôs configuration and exit code:**
   ```bash
   docker inspect <container_id>
   ```
   Use this to check exit codes, environment variables, mounts, and other metadata.

4. **Access the container (if it's still running):**
   ```bash
   docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash
   ```
   Allows for deeper inspection inside the container environment.

5. **Perform Linux-level checks:**
   - Check file permissions:
     ```bash
     ls -l /path
     chmod +x file
     chown user:user file
     ```
   - Check dependencies:
     ```bash
     which <command>
     ldd <binary>
     ```
   - Check system resources:
     ```bash
     top
     free -m
     df -h
     ```

6. **Check recent Git changes (if code-related):**
   ```bash
   git log -1
   git diff <previous_commit> <current_commit>
   ```

7. **Rebuild and run locally to reproduce the issue:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t test-app .
   docker run -it test-app
   ```

### üîç Common Root Causes:
- Incorrect `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` in Dockerfile
- Missing environment variables
- Port conflicts
- Volume mount permission issues
- Crash from application code (uncaught exception, dependency error)

## Docker Image Too Large and Slow to Build

### üìå Question:
You‚Äôre reviewing a Dockerfile that builds a Node.js application. The image is over **1.5 GB** and takes **several minutes** to build and push. Your task is to **optimize the Dockerfile** to reduce the image size and improve build performance. How would you approach this?

### üîç Step-by-Step Optimization:

1. **Use a slim or minimal base image:**
   - Replace:
     ```dockerfile
     FROM node:18
     ```
   - With:
     ```dockerfile
     FROM node:18-slim
     ```
   - Slim images remove unnecessary packages and reduce size.

2. **Avoid unnecessary files with `.dockerignore`:**
   - Add a `.dockerignore` file to skip large or unused directories:
     ```
     node_modules
     .git
     logs
     *.md
     ```

3. **Use multi-stage builds:**
   - Example:
     ```dockerfile
     # Stage 1: Build
     FROM node:18 AS builder
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY package*.json ./
     RUN npm install
     COPY . .
     RUN npm run build

## ðŸ§  Question:
**Youâ€™re working in a team where developers frequently push code to the `main` branch, which occasionally breaks the application. As a DevOps Engineer, how would you enforce better Git practices and ensure stability?**

---

## âœ… Detailed Answer

### 1. Introduce a Git Branching Strategy

Organize development using a consistent branching model like **Git Flow** or **Trunk-Based Development**:
- `main`: always production-ready
- `dev`: integration/testing
- `feature/xyz`, `bugfix/abc`: short-lived branches

---

### 2. Enable Protected Branches in GitHub

Prevent direct pushes and enforce code reviews:
- Go to **Settings > Branches**
- Add a rule for `main`
  - Require pull requests (PRs) for all changes
  - Require status checks (CI)
  - Prevent force pushes

---

### 3. Integrate Automated Checks (CI/CD)

Set up GitHub Actions or another CI tool to run checks on PRs:
- Linting
- Docker builds
- Tests  (Unit and Integration)
- This prevents bad code from being merged. 
---

### 4. Use PR Templates and Commit Conventions

- Provide structured PR templates and encourage semantic commit messages to maintain consistency and clarity.

Create `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`:
```
## What does this PR do?
## How was it tested?
## Related issues
```

Use semantic commits:
```
feat: add login endpoint
fix: handle API 500 error
```

---

### 5. Train Developers in Git Best Practices

Educate the team on:
- `git pull --rebase`
- Clean commit history
- Avoiding `--force`
- Resolving conflicts

---

### 6. Setup Git Hooks (Optional)

Automate checks before committing or pushing

- Use local or server-side hooks to prevent poor-quality commits or enforce policy checks (e.g., no TODOs in code).
- Use **Husky** for scalable hook management.

## ðŸ§  Key DevOps Takeaway

As a DevOps Engineer, your job is to enforce safety and stability in the development process through tools like GitHub, CI/CD, and branching strategiesâ€”without slowing down developer productivity.

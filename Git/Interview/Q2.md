## ✅ Day 2: Git Merge Conflict During Deployment

### 📌 Question:
You’re working in a team where two developers have pushed conflicting changes to the same file (`app_config.yaml`) on different branches. During deployment, your pipeline fails due to a merge conflict. You are asked to resolve it and ensure the deployment continues smoothly. What steps would you take?

### 🧠 Answer:

To handle this Git merge conflict and restore the pipeline, I would follow these steps:

1. **Identify the conflicting branches:**
   Let's say the base branch is `main` and the feature branch is `feature/api-update`.

   ```bash
   git checkout feature/api-update
   git pull origin main
   ```

   This tries to merge `main` into the feature branch and reveals the conflict.

2. **List conflicted files:**
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   It will show `app_config.yaml` under “both modified”.

3. **Open the file and resolve the conflict manually:**
   Git marks conflicts like this:
   ```yaml
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   version: v1.2
   =======
   version: v1.3
   >>>>>>> main
   ```

   Edit it to reflect the correct version (e.g., `v1.3` if it's the latest), then save and close.

4. **Mark the file as resolved and commit:**
   ```bash
   git add app_config.yaml
   git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in app_config.yaml"
   ```

5. **Re-run the pipeline locally or push to trigger CI/CD:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/api-update
   ```

   This will trigger the build again (assuming CI is set up).

6. **Create or complete the pull request:**
   If working with GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket, complete the merge or open a PR after conflict resolution.

### 🛠 Extra Tip – Preventing Conflicts in the Future:
- Communicate with the team when changing shared config files.
- Use branch protection and pre-merge validation checks.
- Consider breaking large shared files into smaller module-specific configs if possible.

### 💬 How to Say It in an Interview:
> "If there's a merge conflict during deployment — which usually happens when two people edit the same file — I start by pulling the latest code and identifying the conflict using git status. I then open the conflicted file, resolve it manually by keeping the correct values, and commit the changes. Once done, I push it back and verify the CI/CD pipeline runs cleanly. I’ve seen this often in config files like app_config.yaml — so I recommend communicating within the team, or even splitting large shared configs into smaller files to avoid frequent conflicts."

## Scenario-Based Git Question: Resolving Diverged Branches

**Scenario:**
You are working on a feature branch `feature/login-enhancements`.  
Before pushing your local changes, you notice that the remote branch has new commits made by another developer.  
When you try to push, Git rejects the push because your branch has diverged from the remote.  

**Task:**
Explain the steps you would take to safely integrate the remote changes into your local branch **without losing any local commits**, and then push the updated branch.

**Expected Answer:**
1. **Fetch the latest changes** from the remote repository without merging automatically:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin

2. **Check the differences** between your local branch and the remote branch:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline --graph --decorate origin/feature/login-enhancements

3. **Rebase your local commits** on top of the updated remote branch to keep history clean:
   ```bash
   git rebase origin/feature/login-enhancements


4. **Resolve any merge conflicts** that occur during rebase:
- Marked them as resolved
   ```bash
   git add <file>
   
- Continue the rebase:
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue

5. **Push your updated branch** to the remote (use force-with-lease to avoid overwriting othersâ€™ work):
   ```bash
   git push --force-with-lease origin feature/login-enhancements

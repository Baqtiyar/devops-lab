# How to Check Your AWS Free Tier Expiry Date

Confused about when your AWS Free Tier ends? Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you find out using both email and the AWS Management Console.

## 1. From Email

When you first create your AWS account, you receive a **"Welcome to AWS"** email.  
This email includes the date your **12-month free tier** starts.  
ðŸ‘‰ Search your inbox for: `AWS Free Tier`, `Account Activation`, or `Welcome to AWS`.

## 2. From AWS Management Console

### Step-by-Step:

1. Go to [https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home)
2. Sign in to your AWS account.
3. In the left sidebar, click on **"Bills"** or **"Free Tier"**.
4. Scroll down to see **usage details**, including how much of the free tier you've consumed.
5. You may not see an exact expiry date here, but you can infer it from your **start date** (from email).
6. Some users also find their start date under **"My Account" â†’ "Account Settings"**.

## 3. Set a Reminder

Set a reminder in your personal calendar (Google Calendar, Outlook, or phone) for **11 months after account creation** to review your AWS usage and avoid surprise charges.

## 4. Watch for Expiry Emails

Remember to keep an eye on your inbox before your free tier ends â€”  
**Amazon usually sends a reminder email shortly before the expiry date.**

## I'll provide bonus tip

Create a secure note or document to track important AWS account details (especially if you're managing multiple accounts). You can include:

AWS account email address

Account name
IAM user name(s)
Root user details (avoid saving the password â€” instead, note password hints or use password manager)
IAM user setup details (like MFA status, permissions)
Free tier start date
Reminder date for reviewing usage

# How to Check Your AWS Free Tier Expiry Date

When I created my first AWS account on July 30 2021, I faced several challenges. One of the biggest questions I had was:
“When does my AWS Free Tier end?”

I wanted to be careful with my usage to avoid unexpected charges, but I couldn't find the expiry date easily.

So, I created this step-by-step guide to help others (and my future self) check the AWS Free Tier expiry date using both email and the AWS Management Console.

## 1. From Email

When you first create your AWS account, you receive a **"Welcome to AWS"** email.  
This email includes the date your **12-month free tier** starts.  
👉 Search your inbox for: `AWS Free Tier`, `Account Activation`, or `Welcome to AWS`.

## 2. From AWS Management Console

### Step-by-Step:

1. Go to [https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home)
2. Sign in to your AWS account.
3. In the left sidebar, click on **"Bills"** or **"Free Tier"**.
4. Scroll down to see **usage details**, including how much of the free tier you've consumed.
5. You may not see an exact expiry date here, but you can infer it from your **start date** (from email).
6. Some users also find their start date under **"My Account" → "Account Settings"**.

## 3. Set a Reminder

Set a reminder in your calendar (Google Calendar, Outlook, or phone) for **11 months after account creation** to review your AWS usage and avoid surprise charges.

## 4. Watch for Expiry Emails

Remember to keep an eye on your inbox before your free tier ends —  
**Amazon usually sends a reminder email shortly before the expiry date.**

## I'll provide a bonus tip

Create a secure note or document to track important AWS account details (especially if you're managing multiple accounts). You can include:

→ AWS account email address

→ Account name

→ Root user details (avoid saving the password — instead, note password hints or use a password manager)

→ IAM user name(s)

→ IAM user setup details (like MFA status, permissions)

→ Free tier start date

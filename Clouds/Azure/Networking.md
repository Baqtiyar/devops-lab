# Understanding Networks

A **network** is a logical boundary within which multiple computers, servers, and nodes are interconnected and can communicate with each other. These nodes communicate through various mediums such as the **internet**, **Local Area Networks (LANs)**, or **Wide Area Networks (WANs)**.

Think of your social media platforms as separate networks. For example, if your friend is on **Snapchat**, you can't directly connect with them through **Facebook**. Similarly, **Twitter** and **Instagram** are separate networks—you can only send requests and interact within the same platform. This illustrates how networks have logical boundaries.

## Why Do We Create Networks?

The primary purpose of creating a network is to allow applications and systems to **communicate within a defined, secure boundary**. Networks provide **isolation and separation** to protect resources and ensure controlled communication.

For instance, a company like **Goldman Sachs** will have its own private network. Inside the organization, different teams might have their own **separate private networks**. These are isolated from one another, but when two teams need to interact, communication can be established—this requires specific **configurations or permissions**.

## Types of Networks

There are two main types of networks:

1. **Private Networks** – Used within organizations (e.g., company networks for internal teams).
2. **Public Networks** – Open networks like the internet, accessible to everyone.

# Understanding Networks

A **network** is a logical boundary within which multiple computers, servers, and nodes are interconnected and can communicate with each other. These nodes communicate through various mediums such as the **internet**, **Local Area Networks (LANs)**, or **Wide Area Networks (WANs)**.

Think of your social media platforms as separate networks. For example, if your friend is on **Snapchat**, you can't directly connect with them through **Facebook**. Similarly, **Twitter** and **Instagram** are separate networks‚Äîyou can only send requests and interact within the same platform. This illustrates how networks have logical boundaries.

## Why Do We Create Networks?

The primary purpose of creating a network is to allow applications and systems to **communicate within a defined, secure boundary**. Networks provide **isolation and separation** to protect resources and ensure controlled communication.

For instance, a company like **Goldman Sachs** will have its own private network. Inside the organization, different teams might have their own **separate private networks**. These are isolated from one another, but when two teams need to interact, communication can be established‚Äîthis requires specific **configurations or permissions**.

## Types of Networks

There are two main types of networks:

1. **Private Networks** ‚Äì Used within organizations (e.g., company networks for internal teams).
2. **Public Networks** ‚Äì Open networks like the internet, accessible to everyone.

# Understanding IP Addresses and Subnet Ranges for VMs

- When you create a **Virtual Network (VNet)**, you define a large IP address range for it (called a **CIDR block**), for example, `10.0.0.0/16`.
- Inside this VNet, you divide that big range into smaller parts called **subnets**. Each subnet gets its own smaller IP range, like:
  - **Subnet 1**: `10.0.1.0/24` (which means IPs from `10.0.1.1` to `10.0.1.254`)
  - **Subnet 2**: `10.0.2.0/24` (which means IPs from `10.0.2.1` to `10.0.2.254`)
- When you create a **Virtual Machine (VM)** inside a subnet, Azure automatically assigns it a **Private IP address** from that subnet‚Äôs range.
- This means every VM‚Äôs IP is **unique within the subnet and within the VNet**.

### IP Address Types

- **Private IP**: Assigned automatically from the subnet‚Äôs IP range; used for **internal communication**.
- **Public IP**: Optional; assigned if you want the VM accessible from **outside Azure**.

### Where Does the Public IP Come From in Azure?

- Allocated by **Azure from its pool of global public IP addresses**, when creating a virtual machine.

# Purpose of IP Addresses in Azure

- The main purpose of an IP address is to enable communication.
- **Private IP addresses** are used for communication between resources within an Azure Virtual Network (VNet).
- **Public IP addresses** allow:
  - Inbound communication from the internet.
  - Outbound communication to the internet from Azure resources.
- Many resources in Azure require a unique IP address to identify and communicate with other services.

## üîπ What is IPv4?

- **IPv4** stands for *Internet Protocol version 4*.
- It uses a **32-bit address format**, which allows for around **4.3 billion unique IP addresses**.
- The format looks like this: `192.168.0.1` (four numbers separated by dots).
- It is the most widely used version of IP today.

## üîπ What is IPv6?

- **IPv6** stands for *Internet Protocol version 6*.
- IPv6 uses **128-bit addresses**, allowing for **340 undecillion (340√ó10¬≥‚Å∂)** IP addresses.
- The format looks like: `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334`
- IPv6 is being adopted gradually, but IPv4 is still dominant in most networks.


# What Are SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, RDP When Creating a VM?

A **port** is like a doorway into your virtual machine that allows specific types of network traffic to enter or leave.

When you create a Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure, you‚Äôll see options to open slots like SSH and HTTP. These define how you can connect to or access the VM:

- **SSH (Port 22)** ‚Äì Used to remotely connect to a **Linux VM**. Works only if the VM has a **public IP** and **port 22 is open**.
- **HTTP (Port 80)** ‚Äì Used when hosting a **web application or website** on the VM. Opening port 80 lets anyone on the internet access your site by typing the VM‚Äôs **public IP** into their browser.
- **HTTPS (Port 443)** ‚Äì Used for **secure web traffic** (TLS/SSL).
- **RDP (Port 3389)** ‚Äì Used for **Remote Desktop access** to **Windows VMs**.

## Network Port in Laptop?

A **network port** in your laptop works just like a port in a **Virtual Machine (VM)**.  
A network port is a **virtual "door"** through which data enters or leaves a device (like your laptop or a VM). Each port is associated with a specific service (like SSH, HTTP, file sharing, etc.).

### üè¢ Real-World Analogy:

- Imagine your **laptop or VM** as an **apartment building**.
- Each **port** is like a **door** to a specific room/service:
  - Room 22 = SSH
  - Room 80 = HTTP
- Data from the internet or other systems enters through these doors.

## üîê What is a Firewall (in Your Laptop and VM)?

A **firewall** is like a **security guard** that watches all the doors (ports):

- It decides which ports are **open or closed**, and **who can use them**.
- It **blocks bad traffic** and **allows trusted traffic** based on the rules you set.
- In **AWS**, it's called **Security Groups**.
- In **Azure**, it's called **Network Security Groups (NSG)**.
